## Format
The pull request title must contain the action and optional short description of the changes. For example:
```ts
// Commands refactor
// Refactor: Commands ands embeds
```

## Merge
If the pull request contains more than 5 commits, you must use **squash and merge**, otherwise you must use **merge**.

Every pull request must be **approved by two or more project administrators**. Do not forget to use **comments** in the pull request.

In the development version, the pull request must be to the **development** branch. If the pull request is to **master** branch, it will be accepted with **squash and merge** and you must update the project version. For example, if the last version in the master branch is 1.0.0 and the changes are simple, the commit must be 1.0.1 or if it needs to change the version you can decide it with the other organization's members in the [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/fazttech).
